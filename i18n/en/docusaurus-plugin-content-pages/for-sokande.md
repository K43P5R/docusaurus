# For Applicants

## The Job and the Future

The business sphere is constantly evolving. By combining deep technical expertise with advanced industrial economics knowledge, you gain the tools to tackle and solve complex problems from multiple perspectives. The work of an engineer in Industrial Engineering and Management primarily focuses on technology-based business development in both established and emerging industries. Consequently, roles such as technology and management consultant, project manager, product developer, investment manager, marketer, or entrepreneur are examples of careers available to graduates. Many alumni quickly move into leadership positions after completing their studies.

## Industrial Engineering and Management – The Field

The field of Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM) focuses on theoretical and practical knowledge about managing innovation, production, and marketing in established and emerging industries. The core lies in developing and organizing efficient industrial operations, profitable technology-based businesses, and fostering conditions for innovation, development, and growth. The natural starting point for research and education is the organization (company/department/project) and its operations. However, since organizations are not isolated entities, the field also considers their historical and contemporary contexts, technical and economic decision-making conditions, and the work environment for their employees. IEM is an applied field at the intersection of technical, social, and human sciences.

Courses in Industrial Engineering and Management stand out by addressing problems that require both technical and economic expertise to solve from an industrial perspective. Central topics include models and theories on managing and organizing technology-driven businesses.

## The Education

The Master of Science program in Industrial Engineering and Management emphasizes the interaction between technical problem-solving and economic contexts. The program integrates technology, economics, and leadership, focusing on the ability to communicate and collaborate across disciplines. Throughout your education, you will take courses in IEM that deepen year by year. From the first year, you will also study mathematics and natural sciences alongside IEM courses.

In the second and third years, you specialize in both IEM and a technical focus area. During this time, you take courses alongside students from other engineering programs. This parallel learning in IEM and technology/natural sciences continues throughout the undergraduate program, culminating in a bachelor's thesis at the end of the third year.

In the fourth and fifth years, you deepen your knowledge within the framework of the master’s program in Industrial Engineering and Management (TIEMM). This involves advanced-level studies in both IEM and your chosen technical specialization, concluding with a master’s thesis.

Many students in the IEM program take advantage of opportunities for one or two semesters of exchange studies.

## Courses in Year 1

During the first year, you will take courses in mathematics, programming techniques, Excel, and mechanics. You will also begin your studies in IEM by taking three different courses in the field.

Mathematics (several courses): 22.5 ECTS
Industrial Engineering and Management (several courses): 22.5 ECTS
Programming Techniques and Excel: 7.5 ECTS
Mechanics, Introductory Course: 8 ECTS

## Courses in Year 2

In your second year, you will take mandatory courses in areas such as differential equations, numerical methods, and statistics, alongside IEM courses. You will also choose a technical focus area to specialize in, studying courses in this area alongside IEM courses.

Industrial Engineering and Management (several courses): 18 ECTS
Technical Focus Area Courses: 27 ECTS
Differential Equations: 6 ECTS
Numerical Methods: 6 ECTS
Probability Theory and Statistics: 6 ECTS
Electromagnetism and Wave Theory: 7.5 ECTS

## Courses in Year 3

In your third year, you will continue to take IEM courses alongside those in your chosen technical focus area. The third year concludes with a bachelor's thesis worth 15 ECTS.

Industrial Engineering and Management (several courses): 18 ECTS
Technical Focus Area and Elective Credits: Approximately 27 ECTS
Bachelor’s Thesis, Basic Level: 15 ECTS

## Courses in Year 4-5 

During the fourth and fifth years, you will deepen your knowledge within the framework of the master’s program in Industrial Engineering and Management (TIEMM). This involves parallel studies in IEM and your chosen technical specialization at an advanced level. Since courses vary depending on specialization, no general credit breakdown is provided, but all students complete a master’s thesis worth 30 ECTS.

Various Courses Depending on Technical Specialization: 90 ECTS
Master’s Thesis, Advanced Level: 30 ECTS
