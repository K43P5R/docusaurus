# For admitted students
## Congratulations on Your Spot in Industrial Engineering and Management!

This is where it begins! The section has a vibrant student life, and during the spring, 150 dedicated students work to warmly welcome a new cohort with open arms. To ensure that you, the new students, get to know your class and have the best possible start to your time at KTH, your adventure begins with the Reception.

On August 14th, it’s time for the enrollment meeting. When you arrive at campus in the morning, you’ll be divided into 16 small groups, also known as Mentor Groups. This marks the start of the Reception, which involves exciting activities from morning to evening. You’ll get an introduction to the section’s traditions and attend sittings that include dinner, singing, performances, and after-parties. Most of the time, we’ll be around campus to familiarize you with KTH’s areas, but occasionally, we’ll go to other places in Stockholm. Participation in the Reception is entirely voluntary (however, the enrollment meeting is mandatory. If you cannot attend, you must contact student counselor Michelle Eng Medin at svl-cinek@itm.kth.se).

A few days before the enrollment meeting, one of your Mentors will contact you to check in and remind you of what’s good to have available during the Reception (see below). A couple of weeks before the enrollment meeting, the schedule for the first two weeks will be published on KTH’s website, followed by updates every two weeks. If you have any questions before then, feel free to contact the Head of the Reception (ÖPH), who is responsible for the event. ÖPH 2025 is Rebecka Larsson Hjelm, and she can be reached at oph@iare.nu.

## What should I bring?
### First day

Many activities will take place outdoors, including on the first day. Make sure to wear clothes you’re comfortable sitting on the grass in. The most important thing is to **bring a valid ID** for the enrollment meeting! Also, dress appropriately for the weather.

### The rest of the Reception
The Reception includes a variety of activities from morning to evening. The following clothing items might be useful during the weeks, so it’s good to have them readily available:

* Formal wear for upscale sittings, such as a dark suit or a dress
* Fun costumes for themed sittings
* Evening gown/tailcoat/dark suit for our most formal sittings
* Swimwear

## Housing
### Joing the housing queue!

You can do this at sssb.se. It’s never too late to join the queue, and you never know when your accumulated queue time might come in handy. SSSB regularly posts last-minute student rooms, which are offered on a first-come, first-served basis. If you’re lucky, you might secure a last-minute room even if you don’t have many queue days. SSSB is the student housing agency co-owned by THS (The Student Union at KTH) and several other unions in Stockholm. To live in or join SSSB’s queue, you must have a THS membership. Other organizations also offer student housing. One of them is Stockholm Housing Agency (Stockholms stads bostadsförmedling). You can learn more about their student housing here: http://www.bostad.stockholm.se/sv/Student/



### Private Rentals

Many private individuals rent out rooms or apartments in Stockholm. You can find private listings on websites such as akademiskkvart.se. Akademisk Kvart is a second-hand rental service that caters specifically to students. Listing ads and becoming a member are completely free for everyone. Akademisk Kvart aims to offer only second-hand rentals with reasonable rent levels. To support this, they provide information about standard contracts and regulations, check landlords, and share knowledge about fraud in the industry. Akademisk Kvart stays constantly updated on Stockholm’s housing market.

**Välkommen!**
