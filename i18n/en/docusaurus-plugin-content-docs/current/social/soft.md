# SOFt

### What is SOFt?

SOFt (chapter Official Fixer Team) is not an ordinary committee, but rather a tool for the chapter and is the committee that maintains and protects the chapter's assets. Our goal is to create a pleasant environment for everyone in the chapter! This is done primarily through the maintenance of shared resources, but also through various initiatives to create a more pleasant environment for all members, such as running creative projects and addressing things that need repair or updating. We are also responsible for the section car, Volkis, which is used to facilitate transportation and activities within the organization.

SOFt is the committee for those who are curious and open to solving problems and learning new things, while making sure that the chapter has a welcoming and pleasant place to gather!
