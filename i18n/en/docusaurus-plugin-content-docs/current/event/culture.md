# Culture Committee

## Activities
The culture board is a relatively new board and is one of the boards within the section that has the most loosely defined purpose, which means that we have a lot of freedom in what we do! Some winning concepts within the committee over the years have been cheese and wine tastings, friend sittings and the Subway sitting.

## Organisation

The committee consists of about 40 students, which is perfect for getting to know people in the section, partly in your own year, but also students in other years. As a member, you are part of a nice group where we together develop and come up with new ideas for our events where the goal is to create an exciting and eventful student life on the side of studies. We hope to see you at our events during the year!
