# International Group

### What is the International Group?

The International Group is the committee within the I-Chapter responsible for the inclusion of international students belonging to the I-Chapter. We welcome international students to our chapter during THS International Reception and are available to answer their questions. During the year, we organize various events for the international students, everything from pub nights and cooking evenings to hikes and sports events. To make the events as successful as possible, we collaborate with other committees, allowing us to arrange a wider variety of activities.

### Organization
Currently, the International Group has 30 members, and the organization is decentralized and dynamic, allowing members to contribute ideas and take their own initiatives.
