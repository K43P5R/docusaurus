# I-Case

### What is I-Case?

I-Case is an attractive recruitment platform for Stockholm’s business community. The committee’s purpose is best described as a bridge between Stockholm’s business sector and the students of the I-Chapter. Through I-Case, you get to develop your skills in case-solving while visiting a variety of companies throughout the year that are interested in recruiting you!

### Size and Organization
I-Case as an organization consists of a board that works hard to connect students in the Industrial Engineering chapter with potential future employers. We always recruit first-year students to ensure the committee’s future.

Additionally, all students in the Industrial Engineering section are welcome to attend our events (subject to availability)!

Our events vary but usually have the following format:
- Group case-solving, where you receive a business case to solve and present
- Presentation of the completed case and valuable feedback from company representatives
- Dinner and mingling with company representatives
- Case practice at school, which for instance can be practice prior to your case interview

I-Case is open to everyone (regardless of academic year) and also offers training in basic economic models and approaches as well as case-oriented presentation techniques! Towards the end of the year, we organize the I-Case Challenge case competition where Industrial Engineering students from KTH, LTH, LTU, CTH, and LiTH compete against each other. We also organize TIMES together with ESTIEM, which is the European Championship in case-solving for IEM-students!

All that is required from participants at our events is a positive attitude and curiosity!
