# ESTIEM

ESTIEM does not purely operate as a committee here at KTH but exists as part of a
bigger organization in Europe with the same name (European Students of Industrial
Engineering and Management). The purpose of ESTIEM is to promote international
relationships among all IEM students and support their personal development.

As a member of the committee you will have the opportunity to discover different
cultures through exciting trips, festivals and often weekend long exchanges across the
whole continent. ESTIEM also arranges the biggest case competition for IEM students,
study visits and various courses where students can network with companies and
develop skills and experiences that complements their academic education. The
common ground for all of these events is that they offer affordable trips, enjoyable
company and often night-long parties for those who want to join.

Aside from traveling around Europe, our members often participate in project groups
for our events held exclusively for the chapter members like cozy quiz pubs, the
renowned Destination X and the local qualification round for the big yearly case
competition.

If you want to know more about us or have any questions you are welcome to swing by
our recruitment pub and get the chance to win a guaranteed spot for Destination X! We
are looking forward to receiving your application and meeting you for an interview!
