### Organization:
The Corporate Relations Committee consists of approximately 45 members within the I-chapter. Together with a steering group, a corporate group, and an event group, we work collaboratively to build long-term relationships with different companies.

### Operations:
The Corporate Relations Committee serves as the bridge between the I-chapter and career opportunities. We share the various opportunities companies offer with students through email newsletters, Facebook posts, events, and advertising on our website. By actively building relationships with a range of companies, we aim to establish long-term, mutually beneficial collaborations that provide students with valuable information and future opportunities.
