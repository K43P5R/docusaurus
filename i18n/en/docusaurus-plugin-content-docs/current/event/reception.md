# The Reception

The reception is about welcoming the new generation of I-are in the absolute best way, with porter-brown ovvars and schmecks. With two weeks until the start of the semester, we gather on campus and welcome the newly admitted students in the best way we can! The reception is the section's biggest event with over 170 members who are there for zero!

The reception is managed by MSG (The reception steering group), with elected ÖPH at the head, which in December starts planning the project alongside the studies. Towards the spring, Phöset is recruited, who ensure that the n0ll's reception experience is the absolute best possible, and the sights are set on August when the entire campus is colored with ovvars and frock coats from all possible sections. How long does the reception last? It's the best, it lasts as long as needed! Rumor has it that it lasted a year until Christmas...

Are you thinking of applying for Industrial Economics or are you even a newly admitted I student waiting for Reception to begin? Then you really have something to look forward to! You are on your way to a real adventure and no matter who you are, you will be part of the I section - a place with strong community, lots of laughs and the opportunity for great development. Only the imagination sets limits to where your journey will take you, but one thing is certain is that it starts with the Reception! Phöset looks forward to meeting you and promises to do everything to welcome you in the best possible way, no matter who you are or where you come from. You will soon notice that the Reception consists of several secrets and you will get many surprises along the way, so join us and experience a time you will never forget!

Do not hesitate to contact Reception Manager ÖPH Rebecka Larsson Hjelm at oph@iare.nu if you have any questions. Have a good time and see you soon!
