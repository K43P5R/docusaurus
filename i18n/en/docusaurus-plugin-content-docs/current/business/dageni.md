# Dagen-I
Dagen I is the Industrial Engineering and Management programs very own career fair, where we give you the opportunity to make valuable connections with companies and employers. Since 2011, we have been working to create the best platforms for Industrial Engineering and Management students to meet companies that could become your future workplace.

During Event Week, the week before Dagen I, there will be plenty of exciting activities, such as breakfast and lunch lectures, as well as evening events both at KTH Campus and at company offices. The week wraps up with a big fair and a banquet where both company representatives and students are welcome to participate and mingle.

Our goal is to create a career fair with a wide selection of companies that represent the fields you study and want to work in after graduation. Dagen - I consists of apx. 40 members and are together working towards an eventful week!
